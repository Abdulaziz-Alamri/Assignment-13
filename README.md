# Card Payment Method

A simple flutter project showing the UI implementation of Bank Card Registration app where users can add cards information to display


## Work

- Used TextFormFields to recieve Card information
- Validated Inputs and used Keyboard type for number-only inputs
- Used a custom widget (AlertMessage) to display Card after successfully registering it.
- Used Form key to validate all inputs before submittion (by Show Card info button)

- Issues to be fixed:

- *Code can be better, TextFormFields should be seperated into a customWidget*
- *Some of the measurements are off, by a little*
- *Could not find a way to keep TextFormField border on after user Interaction*
